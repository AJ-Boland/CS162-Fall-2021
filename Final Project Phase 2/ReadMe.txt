Stage 2. What is that? It is arbitrary. Working board, movement, combat, player selection and two working buttons seemed like an effective phase 1 in Week 4+ folder

Coming Goals:
	Working walls (This means they are displayed)
	Proper Movement; Current movement has no walls to collide with, and lets you walk through players. Also I believe there may be attack of opprotunity. Will double check.
	Working Vision; maybe phase three, but right now user has omnipotence, can see everywhere all the time. Good for me as debugging programmer but I want them to be immersed. 
	Phase 3:
	Dice system.
	Ranged attacks based on vision system and also eventual weapon system
	Weapon System, attack range, damage modifiers, dice attack system
